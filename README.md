There are two implementations of differential polynomials in the package. There is one that uses differential monomials (`RngDiffPol`) and one based on pronlongations sequences which are essentially collections of polynomial rings with inclusion and derivations between them (`RngMPolProlSeq`). 

Each of these two types has a corresponding element tupe with an `Elt` appended to the end. Currently, `RngDiffPol` is only implemented with a constant base but `RngMPolProlSeq` can have a base which is a differential ring. 

Also term order associated with block rankings are implemented in the prolongation sequences version. 



Example Usage:

```
AttachSpec("diffalg.spec");
Z:=Integers();
Q:=RationalField();

R<t>:=PolynomialRing(Q,1);
f := map<R->R|f:->Derivative(f,t)>;
A := DifferentialRing(R, f, Q);
F := FieldOfFractions(A);
P<x,y>:=PolynomialRingProlSeq(F,2: term_order:=<"dblocks",[[1,2]]>);
f1:=x^2+Diff(y,2)*Diff(x,1)+t;
f2:=Diff(x,1)+Diff(y,3);
```
